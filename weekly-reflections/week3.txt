# ncl
    this week was the ncl practice game
    the categories of challenges I attempted were crypto and password cracking
    
    I learned how to use hashcat to do combination of brute force/dictionary 
    attacks to crack passwords. As well as how messages can be hidden within images
    and what tools there are to either place or discover those messages

    I was pretty lost on the more difficult password cracking challenges and I 
    want to understand how the hashcat program works and more important in what ways it can be used
    to solve more difficult problems

    For the crypto section I was hard stuck on the AES challenge,
    I think i had some good ideas/attempts but I also am not quite sure because
    my understanding of AES encryption is pretty vague,
    When talking about crypto AES comes up frequently and that is definately something
    I want to learn more about.
    next week I'm going to check if there are any sections in Hacking the art of Exploitation
    on AES, and if not maybe find an another source that could help me understand
    AES encryption.

    although I didn't initially plan this when designing my ILC, I spend time this week
    learning rust working through the rust-lang book and accompaning exercises
    partly this is just cause I thought i might like the language but I've also encountered 
    a few binary challenges that were written in rust and think it will benefit me
    to the rust language.
