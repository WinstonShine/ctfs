# week 4-5
    During week 4 I mostly attempted challenges in the ncl games being hosted. 
    The categories I focused on were cryptography, password cracking and network traffic analysis.

    Overall during week 4 and 5 I didn’t make much progress on the MBE labs or
    attempt any ctf challenges I mostly have been reading about countermeasures in 
    the Hacking the art of exploitation book as well as ASLR and Heap exploitation 
    slides provided for the MBE labs ( https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE ).

    I am also trying to find another resource, preferably a book on Binary Exploitation 
    for the future since I am going to need it soon.

    My plans have changed a lot since I made the initial syllabus or plan but 
    I think that’s ok. For the next 2 weeks my plans are to finish the readings 
    I’ve started and then proceed with the next set of MBE labs and then I want to 
    reverse engineer and write the source code for my favorite challenge that I have solved this quarter,
    I think this will be a good way to get a better understanding binaries that I have not tried yet.
    Additionally I think for my final project I want to attempt to write a challenge myself 
    and I think trying to recreate the source code for a binary will be great practice for that.
